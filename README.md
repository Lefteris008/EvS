# EvS (Event detection Via Sentiment analysis)
MSc Thesis Project

This project focuses on Event Detection via Sentiment Analysis. Specialized wrapper classes were created to easily extend the tool with additional ED or SA algorithms.
This project does not automatically apply Sentiment Analysis on existing Event Detection techniques but it rather accompanies the results of the second category and enriches them with sentiment information.

##Planned stages of implementation
1. Pre-Alpha Stage (Codename "**Wave**"): Initial tasks like collecting tweets, creating the main dataset, implementing basic event detection algorithms etc.
2. Alpha Stage (Codename "**Planet**"): Main Event Detection algorithm was implemented, along with the Sentiment Analysis and the Evaluation components.
3. Beta Stage - Feature Lock (Codename "**Gargantua**"): Stage of extensive testing of the main tool components. Finalization of the majority of techniques and tool deployment.
4. Gamma/Delta Stage - Code Freeze (Codename "**Stellar**"): Final stage, delivery of the tool.

Every single stage is expected to include 2-3 substages. You can view them in detail [here] (https://github.com/Lefteris008/MScThesis/milestones).
