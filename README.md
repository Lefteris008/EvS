# EvS (Event detection Via Sentiment analysis)
MSc Thesis Project

This project focuses on Event Detection via Sentiment Analysis. Specialized wrapper classes were created to easily extend the tool with additional ED or SA algorithms.
This project does not automatically apply Sentiment Analysis on existing Event Detection techniques but it rather accompanies the results of the second category and enriches them with sentiment information.
