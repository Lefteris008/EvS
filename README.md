# Event Detection via Sentiment Analysis
MSc Thesis Project

This project focuses on Event Detection via Sentiment Analysis. Specialized classification of the extracted events will be performed after the extraction phase.
The final results will be rendered in an online tool and a paper is expected to accompany the main project and the tool.

##Planned stages of implementation
1. Pre-Alpha Stage (Codename "**Wave**"): Initial tasks like collecting tweets, creating the main dataset, implementing basic event detection algorithms etc are expected to take place during this stage.
2. Alpha Stage (Codename "**Planet**"): Main Event Detection algorithm will be implemented, along with the Sentiment Analysis and the Event Classification components. Development of online tool is expected to start at the final stages of this stage.
3. Beta Stage - Feature Lock (Codename "**Gargantua**"): Stage of extensive testing of the main tool components. JUnit test are planned to be implmented. Online tool is expected to be completed at the end of this stage.
4. Gamma/Delta Stage - Code Freeze (Codename "**Stellar**"): Final stage, delivery of the online/offline tools.

Every single stage is expected to include 2-3 substages. You can view them in detail [here] (https://github.com/Lefteris008/MScThesis/milestones).
