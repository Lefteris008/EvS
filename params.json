Specialized wrapper classes were created to easily extend the tool with additional ED or SA algorithms.\r\nThis project does not automatically apply Sentiment Analysis on existing Event Detection techniques but it rather accompanies the results of the second category and enriches them with sentiment information.\r\n\r\nDetailed Wiki, along with issue tracker, milestone information and JavaDoc was created to help with the tool's future extension.\r\n\r\nFor the quality study that was contacted in the context of the MSc Dissertation, you can read more [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=B23CB6071141F86C!214655&authkey=!AC1VzeoMdJuvtbg&ithint=file%2cpdf).",
